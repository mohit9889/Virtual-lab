We have created a experiment on time dilation.

We have used 
1. Java Script
2. CSS
3. HTML
4. jQuery

1.
Java script is used for giving a proper functioning to all the buttons,textfields and graph.
Main Functions here are
a) strt():- This function runs the clock dynamically and most of the data is passed through here
b) tble():- This function is basically for creating table dynamically and pushing data to make graph

2.
CSS is used for adjusting the contents in the front end.

3.
HTML is used for creating buttons and text fields.

4. jQuery is used to stop animations.
